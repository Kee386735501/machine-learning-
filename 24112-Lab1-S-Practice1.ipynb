    "### A Note on Sparsity\n",
    "\n",
    "Most documents only contain a small subset of the vocabulary, resulting in a very sparse data matrix.\n",
    "To handle the sparsity, in this exercise `data` is represented as a `scipy.sparse.csr_matrix`, which can store sparse matrices efficiently while still allowing efficient row-based indexing.\n",
    "You can learn more about `csr_matrix` and other ways of dealing with sparse matrices at https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/sparse.html.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note, however, that `data` is **not** a normal NumPy array.\n",
    "While most operations will be the same as with a normal dense array, **you cannot use a sparse matrix to index another matrix**.\n",
    "If you need to do this, either first convert the matrix to a NumPy array with the `toarray()` method, or use methods specifically designed to work with sparse matrices."

    "Kim, the co-owner and president of the NFL's Buffalo Bills and NHL's Buffalo Sabres, suffered a cardiac arrest in June and needed CPR from her other daughter Kelly before paramedics arrived and restored her heartbeat.\n",
    "Pegula received the news after returning home to Florida from the French Open, where she lost to eventual champion Iga Swiatek but rose to number eight in the world.\n",
    "\"Suddenly I went from, 'Let's celebrate top 10 in the world' to, 'Do I need to start thinking about my career after tennis a lot sooner than I thought?'\" Pegula wrote in an essay in The Players' Tribune.\n",
    "\"I'm 28 and I take pride in being able to handle every situation thrown at me, but this was a lot.\"\n",
    "Pegula said she wanted to share her mother's story after Bills safety Damar Hamlin suffered a cardiac arrest during an NFL game last month.\n",
    "Pegula went on to play Wimbledon and the U.S. Open last year to reach a career-high ranking of number three.\n",
    "\"I still wanted to play Wimbledon if I knew my mom was O.K.,\" Pegula wrote. \"My dad didn't want me to play, but I knew she would be upset if I skipped because of her.\n",
    "\"I had to deal with a lot of speculation and questions surrounding her health, even shutting down rumours that she had died,\" added Pegula, who lost to Victoria Azarenka in the quarter-finals of this year's Australian Open.\n",

    "sp1 = \"\"\"Juventus outclassed Salernitana 3-0 on Tuesday in Serie A, with two goals and one assist from striker Dusan Vlahovic helping the visitors move up to 10th place in the standings. The game marked a return to form for Serbian Vlahovic, who has struggled with injuries this season, but made his first league start since October. \n",
    "\"You can see physically, he just moves better, looks sharper, he also played well on a technical level today,\" Juventus manager Massimiliano Allegri told DAZN.\n",
    "Juventus got a penalty after 26 minutes when Hans Nicolussi fouled Manuel Locatelli inside the box with Vlahovic converting the penalty.\n",
    "Vlahovic almost netted a second in the 37th minute, but his shot from an acute angle at the edge of the box went just wide of the post.\n",
    "Filip Kostic doubled the lead on the stroke of halftime when he tapped the ball in from close range after Vlahovic's initial shot bounced into his path, providing an unintended assist.\n",
    "Juventus could have scored a third in the last seconds before the break when Locatelli made a run unmarked into the box, but Salernitana keeper Guillermo Ochoa reacted early and parried his attempted lob.\n",
    "Vlahovic got his second goal 80 seconds into the second half when he ran through in the box and smashed the ball low into the right corner.\n",
    "Salernitana almost pulled one back in the 51st minute, with Junior Sambia sending a cross that went through almost everyone in the box, but forward Boulaye Dia was unable to stretch himself in time to guide the ball into the open net.\n",
    "\"The team gave a strong response, we had a good 60 minutes, but got a bit complacent after going 3-0 up and allowed too many shots on goal. We were static in our positions, didn't move around enough and the players know we must absolutely do better,\" Allegri said.\n",
    "\"The first 10 minutes we tended to pass it too much down the right, so we need to improve our passing, be smoother and keep it simple.\"\n",
    "Juve could have added to their tally but were denied by the woodwork with Angel Di Maria hitting the crossbar after 53 minutes and Moise Kean striking the post late on.\n",
    "The result moved Juventus on to 26 points from 21 matches, while Salernitana are 16th with 21 points.\" \"\"\"\n",

    "The team sit third in the Premier League, eight points behind leaders Arsenal, and have the chance to win their first trophy since 2017 when they face Newcastle United in the League Cup final on Feb. 26.\n",
    "\"I always think about the long term, in every club where I was, I have been thinking about long-term work to build a culture, to build a way of playing, to develop the players and the team, obviously,\" Ten Hag told reporters.\n",
    "\"I think in the long term obviously in contracts and in (transfer) windows because I think that is the (right) way.\n",

    "sp3 = \"\"\"A near-historic Philadelphia Eagles pass rush will face the ultimate test on Sunday in Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes, an MVP favourite with no interest in ceding the Super Bowl spotlight.\n",
    "The Eagles established themselves as a terrifying defensive force in the regular season, punishing opponents with an astonishing 70 sacks, two shy of the NFL record, while allowing the second-fewest yards per game.\n",
    "But Mahomes is unlike any quarterback they faced in 2022.\n",
    "\"Mahomes is the guy that extends the plays and drops the dimes,\" defensive end Brandon Graham, who helped the Eagles to the Lombardi Trophy five years ago, told reporters on Tuesday.\n",
    "\"You've got to make sure you can hit him, get him on the ground, create turnovers, make him make bad throws.\"\n",
    "At just 27-years-old Mahomes has already vaulted himself into the history books, joining future Hall of Famer Drew Brees this year as one of only two quarterbacks to throw for more than 5,000 yards and 40 or more touchdowns in multiple seasons.\n",
    "Eagles linebacker Haason Reddick produced a career-best 16 sacks this season but had few answers when asked how the Eagles could contain Mahomes.\n",
    "\"When it comes to Patrick Mahomes, man, he's a tremendous talent,\" he told reporters this week.\n",
    "\"I don't know if you can contain him - I just don't know, he's that good. I won't lie, he is.\"\n",
    "Not even injury appeared to hold back Mahomes in the postseason, when he played in the AFC title match against the Cincinnati Bengals just eight days after suffering a high ankle sprain in the Chiefs' divisional round win.\n",
    "With the game tied and seconds left on the clock in the fourth quarter, he produced a heroic sprint that ultimately helped put kicker Harrison Butker within range.\n",
    "\"I know he was hurting - I know that. He's so mentally tough,\" head coach Andy Reid told reporters at the Super Bowl Opening Night on Monday. \"That run that he made at the end, that was the fastest he's run all year.\"\n",
    "Cornerback James Bradberry said that it would take everything in the Eagles arsenal to stop Mahomes from collecting his second Super Bowl ring.\n",
    "\"You just have to be aware of how dominant he can be. You want to make sure you can contain him, eliminate what he's able to do,\" he told reporters on Tuesday.\n",
    "\"You just want to make sure you put guys in his face. That's what our defensive line has been doing all year.\" \"\"\"\n",

    "sp4 = \"\"\"Los Angeles Lakers forward LeBron James surpassed Kareem Abdul-Jabbar to become the NBA's all-time leading scorer on Tuesday, setting the new mark with a fadeaway jumpshot late in the third quarter of a home game against the Oklahoma City Thunder.\n",
    "'King James', who entered the game needing 36 points to break Abdul-Jabbar’s record of 38,387, sent the sold-out crowd into a frenzy when the ball splashed through the net, raising his arms in triumph as his team mates embraced him.\n",
    "Lakers great Abdul-Jabbar, who took the title from Wilt Chamberlain with his signature skyhook on April 5, 1984, sat courtside at Tuesday's game and stood to applaud James after the record was broken.\n",
    "Play was stopped to recognize the achievement and to let James address the crowd.\n",
    "\"I just want to say thank you to the Laker faithful, you guys are one of a kind,\" James said.\n",
    "\"To be able to be in the presence of such a legend as Kareem is unbelievable, it's very humbling. Please give a standing ovation to 'The Captain.'\"\n",
    "Tributes from his family, U.S. President Joe Biden and students from his \"I Promise School\" were played inside the arena, while NBA Commissioner Adam Silver told Reuters it was an \"historic moment\".\n",
    "\"These types of significant milestones capture the attention of not only basketball fans but broader society,\" Silver said.\n",
    "\"LeBron's pursuit of the scoring record is no exception and billions of people will become aware of this milestone.\"\n",
    "All season long it has been a question of when, not if, James would topple the record. Some thought it may come during Thursday's home game against Milwaukee but James had other ideas.\n",
    "Arriving at the arena in a jet black suit, black shirt and dark sunglasses, James looked like he was going to a funeral.\n",
    "Hours later, he buried Abdul-Jabbar's record.\n",
    "A deafening roar greeted him during the pre-game introductions and another came when he buried a three-pointer five minutes into the opening quarter for his first points of the night.\n",
    "He cut the number he needed to single digits on a straightway three in the second half that sent fans leaping from their seats before the 21-foot, history-making bucket arrived with 10 seconds remaining in the third quarter.\n",
    "\"It's so surreal, because it's something I never made a goal of mine or something I set out to do,\" James said after the game. \"It just happened.\"\n",
    "Drafted into the league as a teenager, the Akron, Ohio native has more than delivered on the massive expectations put on his broad shoulders at a young age.\n",
    "A versatile forward, he helping usher in the era of position-less basketball, winning four titles with three different teams, four MVP awards and four Finals MVP awards.\n",
    "James sits top of the regular season points list followed by Abdul-Jabbar with Utah Jazz great Karl Malone (36,928), late Lakers legend Kobe Bryant (33,643) and Chicago Bulls icon Michael Jordan (32,292) rounding out the top five.\n",
    "\"When I read about the history of the game I never thought that this record would ever be touched,\" James said.\n",
    "\"I just didn't think nobody would have that type of longevity to come out on the floor and play at that level for so long.\n",
    "\"So it's just a complete honor to be a part of this league, to be a part of some of the greats that have ever played this game and to be right at the apex with them.\"\n",
    "Last month, the 38-year-old was named to a record-tying 19th All Star game, a mark also held by Abdul-Jabbar.\n",
    "\"For sure I know I can play a couple more years,\" James said.\n",
    "\"The way I'm feeling, the way my body has been reacting to me throughout the course of this season, I know I can play a couple more years.\n",
    "\"It's all about my mind. My mind is still into it and I am still motivated to go out and try to compete for championships because I feel like that's what I can still do.\"\n",
    "Despite James' historic night, the Lakers fell 133-130 to the Thunder and are now 25-30 on the season.\"\"\""
